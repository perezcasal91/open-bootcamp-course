/**
 * Design Patterns Characteristics
 * 1-	A problem that is common for many developers.
 * 2-	Find a strategy for solve the problem and a way to everyone can understand and use.
 * 3-	Like refractoring.guru describe the patterns:
 * -	Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made
 *      blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
 * -	They have a:
 * •	Intent: They show the problem and the way to solve it.
 * •	 Motivation: The problem and the solution are explained in more detail.
 * •	Structure: How they are going to do it and how they are going to compose it.
 * •	Code Example: They show a concrete way of solving the problem.
 * Use Case for Patterns
 * 1-	Creational
 * -	Singleton
 * •	To establish the connection with a database, after establishing the first time we can use it without having to
 *      create it again
 * -	Factory
 * •	To change the language of a site, we make a Factory class that, depending on the language we select, gives us
 *      one or the other.
 * -	Builder
 * •	To build an object without the need to build it completely in the first call, but to do it step by step
 * -	Prototype
 * •	If we want to make a copy of an object, we make a prototype object and then we just call its clone
 * 2-	Structural
 * -	Decorator
 * •	We have a site where we want to send a notification to users in several ways.
 * -	Adapter
 * •	We have a class that only receives data in JSON format but our data comes in XML, so we make an adapter that
 *      allows communication between classes
 * -	Façade
 * •	We have a request from a client but to solve that request we must use several classes, which is not very
 *      understandable on the part of the client, to solve it we create a Facade that performs all the operations
 *      pertinent to the request by the client, for example, we have a library and we give the only methods to use it,
 *      all the others classes are behind are hidden
