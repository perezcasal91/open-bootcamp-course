The default capacity of the Vector is 10, so if we try to add more elements beyond the capacity, the class
Vector would have to resize the Array behind, so in order to do that, it's create a new Array with the
capacity increased by 10 more than original Array, and then copy all the elements from the original Array
to the new one, and then assign the new Array to the original one, so that operation take too long
operational time, that's the problem with the Vectors when we don't know the initial capacity, in other
words, the quantity of the elements that we want to insert into the Vector. So for this particular exercise
we know the initial capacity, it is 1000, so we can initialize the Vector in that capacity, so for the first
time we insert that problem would not happen.
